# Evaluating the First 1000 preprints on EcoEvoRxiv

The goal of this Hackathon is to quantify various attributes of first 1000 preprints to better understand preprint practices and publication pathways in Ecology and Evolution. There are currently well >1100 preprints on the new *EcoEvoRxiv*, which was established in 2018. 

### Hackathon Participants
Anyone registered for the [SORTEE conference](https://events.humanitix.com/sortee-conference-2023-e8dqpa5c) is welcome to join the Hackathon which will take place October, 17th 2023 (8:30-10:30 PM AEST). The Hackathon will be held virtually via [Zoom](https://anu.zoom.us/j/82267359721?pwd=V0JGZHhTMzlNSTM1MjdoblVGZGh2dz09) and run by Daniel Noble, Shinichi Nakagawa and Malgorzata Lagisz as part of the SORTEE conference.

### What will we do?
Participants that are part of the Hackathon will help collect data on a subset of the preprints from *EcoEvoRxiv*. A list of some of the information we would like to collect can be found below. 

The first part of the Hackathon will be a training session where we will go through the data collection process and answer any questions. The second part of the Hackathon will be the data collection itself. We will use a Google Sheet to allocate preprints to participants. We will also use a Google Sheet to collate the data collected by participants. 

### What we intend to produce?
We intend to produce a manuscript that will be submitted to *Nature Ecology and Evolution* as a brief communication. We will also make the data collected available to the public.

The format of the paper as described by the journal is as follows:
- Brief unreferenced abstract – 3 sentences, up to 100 words.
- Title – up to 10 words (or 90 characters). 
- Main text – 1,000-1,500 words, including abstract, references and figure legends, and contains no headings. 
- Display items – up to 2 items, although this may be flexible at the discretion of the editor, provided the page limit is observed. 
- Extended Data – up to 10 items (figures and/or tables, linked from the main text in the html version of the paper).
- Online Methods section should be included.
- References – as a guideline, we typically recommend up to 20. Article titles are omitted from the reference list.
- Brief Communications should include received/accepted dates. 
- Brief Communications may be accompanied by supplementary information. 
- Brief Communications are peer reviewed.

### Co-authorship
If you would like to be listed as a co-author on the resulting manuscript:
1) You will need to have filled out the [delegate data sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UEAUZWpOm7C1kKoVoYy-u_D6cbHoF--EGxoY0Gl0qHw/edit?usp=sharing) so that we can contact you.
2) You will need to complete data collection for at least 25 preprints if you're in attendance.
3)  If you cannot attend, you must either contribute to the data collection for 25 preprints or checking of 50 preprints. 
4) Contribute to any discussion and feedback on the resulting manuscript.
5) Reply promptly to any emails regarding the manuscript (within 2 weeks).

Project organisers will determine their own authorship position. Co-authorship otherwise is determined by the degree of contribution (as determined by project organisers) or for equal contribution authorship is alphabetical. Co-authorship will also be at the dicretion 

Organisers retain the right to to deny co-authorship to anyone who does not meet the above criteria and in special cases (e.g., not following code of contact, not providing authorship details). If you cannot complete all these points or are determined not to have contributed substantially then you will be acknowledged in the manuscript as a Hackthon contributor. 

The manuscript has already been started (see the `ms/ms.qmd` file). The file can be rendered to a word or pdf document. We will be using the data to provide a quantitative analyses that targets key questions outlined in the manuscript.

# Preprint Data Collection

Data for individual preprints will be collected using our [Google Form](https://forms.gle/Ph6DqkH8gZJbhLrP9). The form will be filled out by each Hackathon participant for a subset of preprints.
