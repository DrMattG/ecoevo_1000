### How to collect data from preprints?	
We will use a google form to collect releavnt data about each preprint. The form will be filled out by a each Hackathon participant for a subset of preprints. Training session. We will do a subset of preprints together to make sure we are all on the same page.

Anyone who can't come should check existing data.
