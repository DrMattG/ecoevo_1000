21:15:44 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:

	Yes, it would. I would for some questions. I would say that, if you cannot access it, then you could try another paper. If you don‚Äôt have access to published articles at all, then let us know. We‚Äôll sort out something else
21:16:56 From Elliot Gould To Everyone:
	Replying to "Are the ORCID IDs av..."
	
	Good idea, I found that the metadata in EcoEvoArxiv doesn‚Äôt always link the author‚Äôs orcid ID, so you might need to download the paper and look for orcidID there too.

	Very good question. If they don‚Äôt have a scholar account, there are a few options. 1)  Google them to see; 2)  Try to see if they have ORCID; 3) WoS profile (Web of Science). If not, then we‚Äôll chat about what to do about that

21:49:49 From Bruno Soares To Everyone:
	It says to use the link for data and code for the first version of the preprint. So should I always ignore the most recent version and open the first one?
21:50:24 From Bruno Soares To Everyone:
	Also, the paper has two links for data and code (GitHub + Zenodo). Should we give preference for Zenodo because of the doi?
21:50:55 From Shinichi Nakagawa To Daniel Noble(Privately):
	Dan - do you want to start asking questions?
21:56:04 From Matt Lloyd Jones (he/him) To Everyone:
	Couple of issues I encountered so far	1. What to do if links to multiple data/code repos?	2. What if publication date is only 'March 2023' - do I put 01/03/2023?
22:00:12 From Matt Lloyd Jones (he/him) To Everyone:

	Are we going through the answers to the same paper together?
22:02:26 From Melina Souza-Leite To Everyone:
	I went to this google scholar page and it didn‚Äôt say the number of publications on the preprint, so I assumed 0 - so shouldn‚Äôt we trust it, and instead go to the first author‚Äôs gscholar page?
22:02:32 From Melina Souza-Leite To Everyone:

22:02:55 From Joel Pick To Everyone:
	I have a paper that was cited as a pre-print, and is now published and on google scholar only the published version is shown. So what would go in preprint citations versus article citations?
22:03:13 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:
	I have clarified on the Google form Joel
22:03:33 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:
	Only take citations if you are 100% sure its to the preprint
22:03:36 From Stefan Vriend (he/him) To Everyone:
	Replying to "I went to this googl..."
	
	I found the same:	Preprint: 0 citations	Publication: 1 citation
22:03:44 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:

	Yep, if you can narrow down to the preprint version and it says 0, then 0
22:04:57 From Yefeng Yang To Everyone:
	Thanks for organizing such a great project
22:05:09 From Jack Brand To Everyone:
	If the first author has multiple affiliations, do we just take the first affiliation?
22:05:30 From Joel Pick To Everyone:
	I have to go prepare for the next session, but thank you for organising!!

	Thanks everyone!
22:08:47 From Zoe Xirocostas (she/her) To Everyone:
	If the author's first ever publication in google scholar is actually a thesis do we use that year? or do we use the year for their first peer-reviewed publication?
22:09:24 From Stefan Vriend (he/him) To Everyone:
	Is it perhaps helpful if we gather all the questions & conclusions in this chat and add them as a FAQ-like section to the GitHub's README? Happy to do take this on me

22:09:59 From Yefeng Yang To Everyone:
	A very broad question - Dan has introduced many benefits (or hypothese) of preprints at the begining, why not empirically test (at least some of) these hypothese
22:10:04 From Losia Lagisz To Everyone:
	Replying to "Is it perhaps helpfu..."
	
	Thank you for an offer - we are already making changes to the google form
22:10:20 From Knut Anders To Everyone:
	Should I put Israel T. as the first name for Israel T. Borokini or just Israel?
22:10:30 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:
	Replying to "A very broad questio..."
	
	Yep, that‚Äôs the plan!
22:10:35 From Shinichi Nakagawa To Everyone:
	Please make sure to read Google form carefully a lot of details are tehre and your answers will be often already described
22:10:37 From Yefeng Yang To Everyone:

	I mean the objectives of this project
22:10:49 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:
	Replying to "A very broad questio..."
	
	We may not be able to get at them all, but we should be able to do some
22:11:10 From Shinichi Nakagawa To Everyone:
	Replying to "Should I put Israel ..."
	
	Israel T or Israel both are fine
22:11:18 From Losia Lagisz To Everyone:
	Replying to "Should I put Israel ..."
	
	I suggest first name and middle name as provided
22:11:29 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:
	Replying to "Is it perhaps helpfu..."
	
	Thanks Stefan! Yes, we have made changes in the form already, but we sure can add clarification in the README
22:11:37 From Losia Lagisz To Everyone:

	Sometimes people differ by their middle name

22:12:58 From Shinichi Nakagawa To Daniel Noble(Privately):
	Cool
22:13:02 From Daniel Noble To Shinichi Nakagawa(Privately):
	I‚Äôll keep a record and summarise it all
22:13:17 From Daniel Noble To Shinichi Nakagawa(Privately):
	Too much happening! We had a total of 56 people online
22:13:20 From Daniel Noble To Shinichi Nakagawa(Privately):
	Good turnout!
22:13:25 From Yefeng Yang To Everyone:
	Replying to "A very broad questio..."
	
	OK. Maybe I misunderstood it. From the descriptions of the objectives of this project when being introduced, it seems not clear. But it is great you will be testing some of them
22:13:35 From Shinichi Nakagawa To Daniel Noble(Privately):
	Reacted to "Too much happening! ..." with üëç
22:13:38 From James Orr To Everyone:
	It might be good to have a few extra guidelines for ‚ÄúSubmitting_author_first_publication_year‚Äù? I‚Äôm thinking this would be useful especially for cases when a Google Scholar profile is being updated automatically so could have very old but falsely attributed citations (which can happen a lot for people with ‚Äúcommon‚Äù names). Thanks for organising! Looking forward to getting stuck in to data collection üôÇ
22:13:57 From Daniel Noble To Everyone:
